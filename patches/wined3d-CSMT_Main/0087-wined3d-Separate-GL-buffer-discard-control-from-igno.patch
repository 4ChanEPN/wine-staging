Subject: wined3d: Separate GL buffer discard control from ignoring
 MAP_DISCARD.

Ignoring WINED3D_MAP_DISCARD is controlled purely in the main thread,
whereas the other one is controlled in the worker thread. Store them in
separate fields for synchronization purposes.

There are some problems left:
* buffer->flags is still accessed by both threads without sync.
* CSMT=off has a separate codepath that is untested.
