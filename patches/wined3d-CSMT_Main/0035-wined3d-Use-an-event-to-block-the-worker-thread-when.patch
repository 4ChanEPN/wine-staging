Subject: wined3d: Use an event to block the worker thread when it is idle.

I could not find a canonical implementation for this. Suggestions are
welcome.

The main goal was to avoid SetEvent / WaitForSingleObject / ResetEvent
calls at all costs. They go straight to wineserver, bringing it to 25%
CPU time and cutting framerates in half. Hence the extra BOOL to tell
cs_submit when to set the event.

Finding the correct spin count is tricky. The value I set is high enough
to prevent 3DMark2001 car chase high detail from waiting. This benchmark
maps a lot of in-use managed buffers and thus waits for the CS. But what
the ideal number is depends a lot on the game and CPU.

A better heuristic is needed. E.g. we could tell the worker thread when
the main thread is waiting for a resource to become idle and avoid
waiting for the event in that case. We may have to use POSIX
synchronization primitives for efficiency. On the other hand, the
current implementation probably still spins way too much for an
application that throttles the framerate to 30 fps by waiting in its own
code. So it is probably only good enough for Microsoft Powerpoint.

We should also think about blocking the main thread with events if it is
waiting for the worker thread when waiting for resources, the swap
counter or space in the command Stream. This should preserve power when
vsync is turned on.
