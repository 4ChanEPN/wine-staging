Contributing to Wine Staging
----------------------------

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project.

### Reporting bugs

Since WineConf 2015 Wine Staging is an official part of WineHQ, which means you
can report problems directly at [bugs.winehq.org](https://bugs.winehq.org/).
Most of the time bugs found in Wine Staging also turn out to be present in the
development branch, so its recommended to open your bug in the "Wine" product,
unless you are sure its really "Wine Staging" specific. For bugs related to our
binary packages, please open a bug report in the "Packaging" product.

### Submitting patches

Sorry, this repository is deprecated. Please submit your patches to the
[development branch](http://wiki.winehq.org/SubmittingPatches).
