What is Wine-Compholio?
=======================

**Warning: Do not report bug reports at bugs.winehq.org when using this
version! Please take a look at our
[Wiki](https://github.com/compholio/wine-compholio/wiki/Reporting-bugs)
for more information about how to report bugs.**

The **Wine "Compholio" Edition** is a special patched version of Wine that
includes both patches written by our team directly and specific patches by
third party developers that we consider good enough for inclusion. This can
be seen as a testing version in preparation for patches to be submitted
to upstream Wine - don't be surprised if you encounter additional bugs,
which are not present in regular wine, and always report such issues to us
(via github), so we can improve our fixes even further. Thanks!


How to install and use Wine-Compholio
=====================================

Ready-to-use packages for Wine-Compholio are available for a variety
of different Linux distributions directly for download. Just follow the
instructions available on the
[Wiki](https://github.com/compholio/wine-compholio/wiki/Installation).

When using Wine-Compholio there are a few differences compared to regular
Wine. The main difference is that it is not sufficient to type `wine` to
run it, but instead you will have to type `/opt/wine-compholio/bin/wine`.
Besides that there are also some other differences, for example additional
configuration options to tweak performance, which are not available in regular
Wine. All those differences are also documented on the
[Wiki](https://github.com/compholio/wine-compholio/wiki/Usage).
